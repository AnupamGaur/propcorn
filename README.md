_Micro-funding for small features_

## TL;DR

- Propcorn is a protocol that incentivizes open source devs to get paid for their work
- Propcorn incentivizes proejct maintainers to create bounties to help with the development
- Once you create your proposal or bounty, take the link and share it in a github issue
- Here is an example of a bounty: https://github.com/deeecent/propcorn/issues/2

## Problem

Currently, there is little incentive for external contributors to fix issues on GitHub. The responsibility largely falls on core maintainers, who have limited time and a specific agenda. Freelancers or developers with the necessary skills may want to help, but they often can‚Äôt justify the time investment without compensation.

## Solution

Introduce a micro sponsorship platform where developers can propose and fund fixes for GitHub issues. Here‚Äôs how it work:

- A developer finds an interesting issue on GitHub and creates a proposal on the platform, linking it to the issue and setting a price tag.
- The developer shares this proposal via social media, encouraging others to sponsor the fix or feature with cryptocurrency.
- Anyone can contribute until the funding goal is reached.
- Once the issue is resolved, the developer marks the proposal as ‚Äúsolved‚Äù on the platform.
- After a 10-day waiting period (during which sponsors can raise objections), the funds are automatically released to the developer, unless a significant percentage of sponsors veto the payout.
- The platform provider takes a small fee for facilitating this process.

This approach creates a mini-DAO for each issue, enabling flexible, community-driven funding and development. The platform can be used anywhere, such as on GitHub or Twitter, and can even fund its own development through the same process.

There are other similar platforms:

Propcorn is different because it's just a simple protocol that does one simple thing: micro-funding for small features. Just connect with your wallet, create a proposal and share a link, or fund it.
