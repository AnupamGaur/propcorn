_A public good for micro-funding small features_

## TL;DR

Propcorn is a public good designed to incentivize open-source developers by enabling micro-funding for small features or fixes on GitHub. It allows developers to create proposals for issues they find interesting, set a price, and share the link to gather funding from the community. Once the funding goal is met, the funds are released to the developer after a waiting period, ensuring community approval. Propcorn is simple on purpose, focusing only on micro-funding for small development tasks.

## Problem

Currently, there is little incentive for external contributors to fix issues on GitHub. Core maintaners often have this responsibility but they manage already a significant workload with specific priorities. Freelancers or developers with the necessary skills may want to help, but they often can‚Äôt justify the time investment without compensation.

## Solution

Propcorn is a micro-funding public good where developers can propose and fund fixes for GitHub issues. Here‚Äôs how it work:

- A developer finds an interesting issue on GitHub and creates a proposal on the platform, linking it to the issue and setting a price tag.
- The developer shares this proposal via social media, encouraging others to sponsor the fix or feature with cryptocurrency.
- Anyone can contribute until the funding goal is reached.
- Once the issue is resolved, the developer marks the proposal as ‚Äúsolved‚Äù on the platform.
- After a 10-day waiting period (during which sponsors can raise objections), the funds are automatically released to the developer, unless a significant percentage of sponsors veto the payout.
- The platform provider takes a small fee for facilitating this process.

This approach creates a mini-DAO for each issue, enabling flexible, community-driven funding and development. The platform can be used anywhere, such as on GitHub or Twitter, and can even fund its own development through the same process.

Propcorn is different because it's just a simple protocol that does one simple thing: micro-funding for small features. Just connect with your wallet, create a proposal and share a link, or fund it.
